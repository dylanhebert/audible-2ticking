# Audible 2-Ticking
A RuneLite plugin that plays sounds to aid with some 2-ticking allowing the player to at least look away from the screen.
- Plays a sound when a NPC hits the player with a zero/splash (useful for rats & birds)
- Plays a sound to let the player know when their inventory is low on space (useful for knowing when to drop fish/logs)
Currently, this plugin is optimized for 2-tick fishing swordfish in Piscarilius.

## Future Plans
- Teak woodcutting

## Suggestions or issues?
